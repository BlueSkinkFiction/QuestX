The Resort


There is no time, but there is a night zone, where the nightclubs are open all the time, including Starkers

There are two nudist beaches, one is strictly "non-contact".


Zones:

Noir: nightclubs and dining. Women in dresses, men in ties.

The Lap of the Gods: A Greek-style zone, with some random elements. Slaves can be bought and sold

World of Tomorrow: Future, metallic clothing

The Swamp: Amazons and Headhunters battle to capture slaves to serve them.

The Redlight District: Hookers (men and women) sell their bodies

Angels and sinners: Nudist area, visitors can choose to wear a headband, which gives them an aura. Any one tryong to touch them just feels pain - they are the angels. Take it off and become a sinner.

The Control Zone: BDSM; enter one door to be a top or the other to be a bottom. Any bottom not claimed within 15 minutes goes to the slave auction. Bottoms can expect a lot of pain and very little privacy.


'Though those two doors is the "Control Zone".
