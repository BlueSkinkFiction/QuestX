The Resort


There is no time, but there is a night zone, where the nightclubs are open all the time, including Starkers

There are two nudist beaches, one is strictly "non-contact".


Zones:

Noir: nightclubs and dining. Women in dresses, men in ties.

The Lap of the Gods: A Greek-style zone, with some random elements. Slaves can be bought and sold

World of Tomorrow: Future, metallic clothing

The Swamp: Amazons and Headhunters battle to capture slaves to serve them.

The Redlight District: Hookers (men and women) sell their bodies

Angels and sinners: Nudist area, visitors can choose to wear a headband, which gives them an aura. Any one tryong to touch them just feels pain - they are the angels. Take it off and become a sinner.

The Control Zone: BDSM; enter one door to be a top or the other to be a bottom. Any bottom not claimed within 15 minutes goes to the slave auction. Bottoms can expect a lot of pain and very little privacy.

'Okay, great. Look, as I said, I'm really busy, and I don't have time to wet nurse a rookery who's still shitting yellow, so here's what's going to happen. I'm going to message the various chiefs to let them know you're here, and you;re going to spend the day getting to know the station and the people you will report to. Some of them might have jobs for you; that's great. When I've something more definite for you to do, I'll let you know. So if you've got any questions... go ask someone else. Dismissed!'
'Er, yes sir. Thank you sir.'



Infinity station is a commercial starport that the service rents space on. The more usual practice is to have their own orbital, where service brothels, bars and casinos are available, so the service men can spend all their wages giving them back to their employee.
